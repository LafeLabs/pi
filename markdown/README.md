#  Markdown

## Goals

1. make a document with headers, links, images, lists, bold, italic, code blocks, paragraph breaks
2. create new markdown documents, delete them, copy them
3. learn to use math in markdown if you are a math person, using mathjax/latex

paragraph breaks are double enter/return.  
or just add 2 spaces at end of line.  
another line?

headers scale down in size from the biggest with one "#" then "##", then "###" and so on

```# header 1```

```## header 2```

```### header 3```


Code blocks are three back ticks. 

```
```
code here
```
```

Inline `code` is with one back tick

Code blocks demonstrating markdown specifically can be a problem for formatting sometimes, and one can use the HTML tag "pre" instead.

Links are with first square brackets for the text and then parenthesis for the destination URL(web address).


For example:

`[link text](http://www.website.org/page)`

This can also point to a local address on the server, with a relative url like 

`[link text](php/replicator.txt)`


A list of items without numbering is created with dashes and spaces, both before and after the dash

<pre>
 - item
 - another item
 - yet another item
</pre>

Numbered lists use numbers with periods, followed by spaces

<pre>
1. first item
2. second item
</pre>

*italic* and **bold** 

`*italic*` and `**bold**`

Images are inserted with the format `![optional alt text](image url)`.  An image link inserts the image inside where the text would normally go in a link: `[![](image url)](link url)`

## Actions for learning Markdown:

Use all these to edit this document.  Click the link to edit, add paragraphs, headers, links, images, lists of items, see the existing examples, and use them to copy and paste to make things.

Things to edit or create in your version of this document:

 - a header
 - a paragraph
 - bold and italic
 - an image
 - an ordered list
 - an un-ordered list
 - a link
