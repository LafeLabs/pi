#  Off Grid Power

This should be folded into the networking hardware.  All off the shelf.  No hydro. Just off the shelf solar panels, batteries, charger, cables, wifi bridges and other off the shelf hardware to extend network links over miles without any grid.  

One chapter should be this whole setup with a very simple example that will always work for a clear use case: extend a mile, with the ability to keep adding.
