## Goals of class

This class teaches web development, network administration and engineering by building usable infrastructure for community based off-grid social networking.  Students will train to become a station operator of a Raspberry Pi based network node which has both a web server, a battery charging station, a wifi hotsot, and its own local social networking software which students will manage for the community.  Repeaters will be built into each station, so that a line of stations along a trail, river, shoreline, shipping lane(via buoys) can extend network access along the whole line, connecting people in remote areas to locally controlled social media which can be used to connect people in a way that is based in the land: each station represents not just an operator and community but a physical place, which people will share information about(wildlife, water, weather, etc.).  

This class serves as the jumping off point for a whole set of classes using this same platform to build more infrastructure of direct use to remote communities, including further telecom infrastructure with a radio engineering curriculum, off grid energy, citizen science(water quality monitoring and study) and trash-to-use manufacturing(trash robots).

## Curriculum

1. structure and concepts, fork a server, edit a page. 
2. install server, learn types of server, fork them out from your own main server
3. markdown.  Edit a page using markdown, use all the basic markdown syntax elements. optional: latex, mathjax, and math, ipython notebooks. Make a self-replicating github repository
4. HTML.  make code server, use to make a home page, use all the basic elements of html. Make a self-replicating page with github, push to a public free server 
5. CSS/style. Use all of a list of basic layout tools, make pure CSS art, create pages with it in code server, share to [codepen](https://codepen.io/)
6. JavaScript. DOM, JSON, objects, functions, PHP connection to file system, libraries we use, how to write a library, geometron libraries, onchange, onclick.  Write a calculator, push it to github and relicate it to the web on a public page. Optional: p5.js
7. PHP.  links, reference, examples, standard programs used in the system, structure of the replicator, for loops, variables, OOP, JSON, how to embed in HTML.  
8. Pi terminal setup.  Put kit together, install everything, get it all working at home plugged into the wall over existing wifi.
9. Build pi kiosk with off grid power using solar or water power.
10. Build microwave repeater for station to extend network access.
11. Use to create and share social media in the community along a linear network you build, share with others who train to become operators and build their own stations, extending the network, learn to teach others to become operators, spread the system
