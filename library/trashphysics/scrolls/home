## Methodology

I will dive into problems with physics illustrated through stories one at a time to creator chapters in "problem", then for each problem I will add a "solution" chapter.

Should there three books, problems, stories and solutions? maybe  or maybe this just needs a pre calculated structure now.

## Book I: Problem

 - the cult of the bomb
 - the true nature of the military industrial complex
 - biggism: the reductionist dead end
 - novelism: novelty over utility
 - overspecialization: same thing?
 - casual toxic waste
 - toxic culture: white supremacy and misogyny   
 - inequality
 - shark tank culture
 - funding
 - textbooks disconnected from physical reality
- biggism
- newism
- patriarchy 
- white supremacy 
- reductionism
- college old boy networks
- Dr. Strangelove culture
- the cancer of silicon valley
- quantum delusions
- accelerating inequality in academia
- the pyramid scam of academia
- powerpoint culture
- intellectual property
- classification
- completely pointless fields

## Book II: Solution

 - cosmology shift
 - what exactly is physics?
 - a shift in leadership to indigenous, local
 - what is physics? define it.
 - why should we have physicists?
 - despecialization
 - abolition of academia
 - the library
 - mutual aid, community physics
 - trash factory, direct manufacturing
 - support model
 - text books are living documents based on things we build from trash in local community but which teach the core of PHYSICS
 - recentering cosmology on land, water, living things, community
 - re combine things which were separated: art, child care, mutual aid, spirituality, science, alchemy, technology
 - turn to indigenous leadership
 - integrate children into all phases of process
 - sift all of physics into a set of skills which are of most general use based on our work from 1600 through 1950
 - support all our work locally, entirely from our direct community
 - release everything we make on the TRASH ROBOT LIBRARY including this book
 - abolish the phd abolish academia
 - abolish college
 - curriculum based on actions which all have direct benefit and also prove skills
 - instigate a mass resignation from military industrial complex jobs
 - let cultural leaders across a broad cross section of society lead, and physics follow
 - active participation by non-working people(retired, home maker, disabled, unemployed, travelers)
 - the trash physics pibrary is a library of libraries of books which are sets of scrolls in geometron/trash robot pibrary system which document all the curriculum, all the builds, all the history
 - the books in the trash physics pibrary will be written by the community, and will evolve in the wild.  rather than "read" a book and then do "assignments", learners will always actively engage the text and add to it, as well as leave asks for the next people to improve it, always leave the text better than you found it


## Some stories

 - plutonium
 - toxic chemicals at berkeley
 - toxic chemicals at apl
 - nsa funding stories, disconnect from rest of society
 - the idiocy of my work at apl
 - quantum startups, chad 
 - why techshop was a failed model, stories about it
 - why concoctory was a failed model, stories about it
 - my personal story of quantum computing, observation of growth of quantum delusions
 - all the mr. hoyt stories
 - talcott mountain academy and why it sucked
 - APL stem program and why it sucks
 - why my career is stupid
 - why all my colleagues' careers are stupid
 - mr hoyt as model but also flaws of mr hoyt
 - college stories why i hate college
 - grad school stories why i hate grad school
 - low temperature physics stories why it sucks
 - the stupidity of funding at apl, specific stories
 - my projects and why they cannot be supported in the current system
 - rob and the jasons
 - yale mafia
 - IBM
 - Aric and the raspberry pi and the radio testing hardware/software
 - concoctory as model but also as what is wrong with system, why it didn't work
 - techshop and why it sucked
 - the collapse of physics career tracks, endless post docs, winner take all academia, how i've seen it all get worse, where it's all going
