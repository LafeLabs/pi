 - novelism: novelty over utility
 - overspecialization: same thing?
 - casual toxic waste

 - inequality
 - shark tank culture
 - funding

## Book II: Solution

 - abolition of academia
 - the library
 - trash factory, direct manufacturing
 - support model

 - the idiocy of my work at apl
 - my personal story of quantum computing, observation of growth of quantum delusions
 - why my career is stupid
 - why all my colleagues' careers are stupid
 - mr hoyt as model but also flaws of mr hoyt
 - college stories why i hate college
 - grad school stories why i hate grad school
 - low temperature physics stories why it sucks
 - the stupidity of funding at apl, specific stories
 - my projects and why they cannot be supported in the current system
 - rob and the jasons
 - yale mafia
 - IBM
 - Aric and the raspberry pi and the radio testing hardware/software
 - concoctory as model but also as what is wrong with system, why it didn't work
 - techshop and why it sucked
 - the collapse of physics career tracks, endless post docs, winner take all academia, how i've seen it all get worse, where it's all going

## Methodology


I will dive into problems with physics illustrated through stories one at a time to creator chapters in "problem", then for each problem I will add a "solution" chapter.

Problems include:

- biggism
- newism
- patriarchy 
- white supremacy 
- Dr. Strangelove culture
- the cancer of silicon valley
- quantum delusions
- inequality in academia
- the pyramid scam of academia


Solutions include:

 - recentering cosmology on land, water, living things, community
 - re combine things which were separated: art, child care, mutual aid, spirituality, science, alchemy, technology
 - turn to indigenous leadership
 - integrate children into all phases of process
 - sift all of physics into a set of skills which are of most general use based on our work from 1600 through 1950
 - support all our work locally, entirely from our direct community
 - release everything we make on the TRASH ROBOT LIBRARY including this book
 - abolish the phd
 - instigate a mass resignation from military industrial complex jobs
