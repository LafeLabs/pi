# Geometron
 
Geometron is a geometric language and a system of self-replicating media.  It is documented in the Book of Geometron.  The whole network described here runs on the Geometron system.  This is entirely built on Raspberry Pi now but will in the future be based on fully trash-built media as described in the Book of Geometron.

For our purposes here, Geometron is centered on the Raspberry Pi open computing platform and public facing web pages.
