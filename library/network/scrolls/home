# Book of the Network

We will build a global network of local networks.  "Network" here means the network of relationships between actual humans, not computer networks.  We are creating a network of Operators, who connect people in a physical location by building up libraries of self-replicating documents shared across computer networks between people in a shared physical space. 

This network of networks is a public utility owned by no one and controlled by no central entity.  This is the basis of the TRASH MAGIC economic system in which all things are made locally with the sun and trash.  TRASH MAGIC requires a global network of freely replicating documents, GEOMETRON. We are going to sustain growth of that network by making money teaching and promoting content which can support the research and development required to create full TRASH MAGIC.

Each node in the Geometron/TRASH ROBOT network is a for-profit LLC owned and operated by an individual who also has other roles on an unpaid basis.  It is self-replicating in that part of the business model is training other Operators to start their own network nodes.  All promotion is under the open brand of TRASH ROBOT which is common property, not owned by any one operator and usable by all with no restrictions.
