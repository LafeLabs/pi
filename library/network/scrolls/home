# Geometron Library

*empowering communities through networks*

The elements of the network are:

 - the raspberry pi servers
 - public off-grid computer stations with raspberry pi
 - libraries are sets of books. Books are self-replicating sets of Geometron documents: text, graphics, and images as well as some other formats. Libraries and books can both also contain more libraries
 - community creators who write the content of the books
 - authors who compile all the content into books 
 - librarians who organize the books into libraries
 - developers who maintain the code and share it
 - the free wireless networking infrastructure to provide free Internet access in public spaces

Some libraries:

 - food library
 - history library
 - government library
 - library library
 - aid library
 - library of commerce
 - lore library
 - art library
 - music library
 - code library
 - arduino library
 - trash robot library
 

Geometron libraries are a network knowledge resource for physically local communities.  They provide free Internet access and free access to a library of books co-created by the community to provide broad access to shared local knowledge.  Books document the community as well as the creative output of the community, including history, resources, commerce, culture, myths, geography, politics, all the other libraries in the community, the existing social networks, and the local living things.

Books are all created using the Geometron system on the Raspberry Pi low cost open source computing platform.  The Raspberry Pi running Geometron acts as a server for freely shared documents, which can replicate from one server to the next across the system.  

In order to create the most free access to both consuming and creating this knowledge, our network also provides free wireless Internet access, using community operated networks we train people to build.  

We will raise grant money to directly empower communities which pay for all the hardware to run this system(off the shelf wireless networking hardware, raspberry pi hardware, and off grid solar hardware), and our time to train operators and to work with community members to co-create the books.  The networks is not a business or a non profit.  

The network will be built into existing institutions and supported by their existing cash flows, be it for profit or non profit or private citizen support.  We will form a close alliance with the main community network hubs that already exist through local libraries, local government, local business, land owners, community organizations, religious institutions, tribal organizations and schools.  In all these cases as with existing social media, the buy in will come from people creating books to document their existence.  

libraries are sets of books

books are sets of scrolls, which can also contain sets of images, symbols, icons, maps or other document types from the Geometron system.

All sets are self-replicating.


 - book of help
 - book of food
 - book of coffee
 - book of artists



We will build a global network of local networks.  "Network" here means the network of relationships between actual humans, not computer networks.  We are creating a network of Operators, who connect people in a physical location by building up libraries of self-replicating documents shared across computer networks between people in a shared physical space. 

This network of networks is a public utility owned by no one and controlled by no central entity.  This is the basis of the TRASH MAGIC economic system in which all things are made locally with the sun and trash.  TRASH MAGIC requires a global network of freely replicating documents, GEOMETRON. We are going to sustain growth of that network by making money teaching and promoting content which can support the research and development required to create full TRASH MAGIC.

Each node in the Geometron/TRASH ROBOT network is a for-profit LLC owned and operated by an individual who also has other roles on an unpaid basis.  It is self-replicating in that part of the business model is training other Operators to start their own network nodes.  All promotion is under the open brand of TRASH ROBOT which is common property, not owned by any one operator and usable by all with no restrictions.
