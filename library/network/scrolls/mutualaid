# Mutual Aid Hub
 
Operators operate a mutual aid hub, asking community members what they have to share and what they need and connecting the two using the magic book system. 

We are network operators. Our role is to connect.  We do not create mutual aid resources, we connect them.  We reach out to everyone doing any kind of local mutual aid, charity, food drives, outreach, harm reduction, etc. and catalog all those resources in a Book in our Library.
