# Promotion Business
 
Big Tech leaves billions of dollars on the table by ignoring small business. We will capture that value by building a new kind of media, a local library of co-created content about and by the local people, which is used to facilitate all local commerce both formal and informal.  We can do this as a public service, in exchange for resources like food, a place to stay and work, or for money, depending on circumstances.  

Our business is the same as Big Tech but more flexible and personal.  We can link any business with customer or any person with any other person in the local community based on need and desire.  

The medium is the Magic Book, in the Magic Library.  All this runs on [Geometron](scrolls/geometron).  I promote it with the [TRASH ROBOT](scrolls/trashrobot) brand, which is shared by all the independent operators.

**Examples**

 - maintain a book for each restaurant with menu, hours, links, all for free food
 - personals ads for cash
 - ads for small time gigs and selling stuff for cash
 - maintain a store book for someone's business The Book Of You, all in magic book format
 - paid ad books for all the various things Big Tech runs apps for: rooms for rent, carshare, ride share, skill share, all goods and services, by mutual consent, like craigslist but much more local and active, and all in the MAGIC BOOK format
