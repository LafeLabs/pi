# Trash Robot
 
Trash Robot is an open brand.   It is used to promote the whole network of Magic Libraries, Geometron, etc. without any intellectual property owned by any one central corporate entity.  It is an aesthetic.  It consists of:

 - rainbows
 - social media accounts all loosely connected promoting the whole network, co-promoting local nodes
 - googly eyes
 - duct tape and cardboard and bamboo
 - clothes lines and parachute cord
 - solid simple colors of cut felt on black cotton flannel
 - geometric constructions using basic shapes like the equilateral triangle
 - block letters made from felt squares with just the bare minimum cut out to see the letter
 - rainbow lights
 - cardboard and sharpie marker
 - stuff made from trash
 - the idea of TRASH MAGIC: build EVERYTHING from trash for free, make it self-replicating
 - the TRASH MAGIC ACTION COLORING BOOK
 - the BOOK OF GEOMETRON
