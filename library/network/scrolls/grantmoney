# Grant Money 

We aim to capture money available for STEM education and workforce development for bridging the digital divide by training Operators to both make a living and directly help their communities.  This mission can be sold to a wide range of sponsors.  Large tech companies, federal government agencies, non profits, and individual wealthy donors can support our work by paying for hardware and classes.  

We will not set up as a non profit, but will always work as a contractor for the prime contractor, working to co-write grants for existing non profits.  We can work through public libraries, universities, non profits of all kinds, town governments and tribal governments.  In all cases we will work as a sub contractor on the grant, and the hardware will all be channeled through the existing non profit to the next generation of Operators.
