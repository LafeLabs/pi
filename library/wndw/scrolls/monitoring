# NETWORK MONITORING

##     Introduction

Network  monitoring  is  the  use  of logging  and  analysis  tools  to  accurately determine  traffic  flows,  utilisation,  and  other  performance  indicators  on  a network.    Good   monitoring    tools   give   you   both   hard   numbers   and graphical  aggregate  representations of  the  state  of  the  network.  This  helps you    to   visualise    precisely   what    is   happening,    so   you   know   where adjustments  may be needed.

These  tools can help you answer critical questions,  such as:

 - What  are the most popular services  used on the network?
 - Who are the heaviest  network  users?
 - What other wireless  channels  are in use in my area?
 - Are  users   installing   wireless   access   points  on  my  private  wired network?
 - At what  time of the day is the network  most  utilised?
 - What sites do your  users frequents
 - Is   the   amount   of   inbound   or   outbound   traffic   close   to   the available  network  capacity?
 - Are   there   indications   of  an   unusual   network   situation   that   is consuming  bandwidth  or causing other problems?
 - Is our Internet  Service  Provider  (ISP) providing  the level of service that we are paying for?

This  should   be  answered   in  terms  of  available   bandwidth,   packet   loss, latency,  and overall availability. And perhaps  the most  important  question  of all:

 - Do  the observed  traffic patterns  fit our expectations?

Monitoring  and  metrics  tools  are  vitally  important  programs  to  have  on hand  to  check  on  the  health  of  your  network  and  diagnose/troubleshoot problems.

Throughout  previous  chapters  in  this  book  we've  mentioned  or  given  brief examples   of  using   certain   tools   for  specific   tasks   like  configuration   and setup,   troubleshooting,   gathering   statistics   and   metrics   data   about   the health  of your  network,  etc.  This  section  discusses  some  of these  tools  in  a more  detailed  manner.   It should   be  noted  that   this  is  by  no  means  an exhaustive  list of all the tools  available  for wired and wireless  networks.

It is also  important  to  realise  that  diagnostic  and  monitoring  tools  change just  like  all  other  software  and  hardware  does.  Staying  up  to  date  on  the latest  versions,  bugs  in existing  versions,  new  tools  in  the  field,  etc.  can  be an almost full-time  job in itself.

For  this  book,  where  we've  found  that  a  certain  tool  is  no  longer  being actively maintained  between  the previous edition  and this one, we have left it out of this  text. The tools discussed  in this section  are all  being currently developed  as  of  this  writing,  but  it  is  left  as  an  exercise  to  the  reader  to determine if a particular  tool is suitable for their situation.

##     Network monitoring example

Let's  look  at  how  a  typical  system  administrator  can  make  good  use  of network monitoring tools.

**An effective network monitoring example**

For the purposes of example, let's assume that we are in charge of a network that  has  been  running  for  three  months.  It  consists  of  50  computers  and three servers: email, web, and proxy servers.  While  initially  things  are  going  well,   users   begin  to  complain   of  slow network speeds and an increase in spam emails.  As  time  goes  on,  computer  performance  slows  to  a  crawl  (even  when  not using the network), causing considerable frustration in your users.

With   frequent   complaints   and   very   low   computer   usage,   the   Board   is questioning  the need for so much network  hardware.  The  Board  also  wants  evidence  that  the  bandwidth  they  are  paying  for  is actually  being  used. As   the   network   administrator,   you   are   on   the   receiving   end   of   these  complaints.


How   can   you   diagnose   the   sudden   drop   in   network   and   computer performance  and also justify the network hardware  and bandwidth  costs?

**Monitoring  the LAN    (local traffic)**

To get  an idea of exactly what  is causing  the slow down,  you should  begin by  looking  at  traffic  on  the  local  LAN.   There  are  several  advantages  to monitoring local traffic:

1.   Troubleshooting  is  greatly  simplified.  Viruses  can  be  detected  and eliminated.
2.   Malicious  users can be detected  and dealt  with.
3.   Network  hardware  and resources can be justified with real statistics.

Assume  that  all  of the switches  support  the Simple  Network  Management Protocol   (SNMP).   SNMP   is  an  application-layer   protocol   designed   to facilitate   the   exchange   of   management   information   between   network devices. By  assigning  an  IP address  to  each  switch,  you  are  able  to  monitor  all  the interfaces  on that switch,  observing  the entire  network from a single  point. This is much easier than enabling SNMP on all computers in a network.

By  using  a  free  tool  such  as  MRTG,  http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/,  you  can monitor   each   port   on   the  switch   and   present   data  graphically,   as   an aggregate average over time.  The graphs are  accessible  from  the web, so you  are able  to view  the graphs from any machine at anytime.

With  MRTG  monitoring  in  place,  it  becomes  obvious  that  the  internal LAN  is  swamped  with  far  more  traffic  than  the  Internet  connection  can support,  even  when  the lab  is  unoccupied.  This  is  a  pretty clear  indication that some of the computers are infested with a network virus.

After  installing  good  anti-virus  and  anti-spyware  software  on  all  of  the machines,  the internal LAN traffic settles down to expected levels. The  machines  run  much  more  quickly,  spam  emails  are  reduced,  and  the users'  morale quickly improves.


**Monitoring  the WAN   (external traffic)**

In  addition   to  watching   the   traffic  on   the   internal   LAN,   you   need   to 
demonstrate   that  the  bandwidth  the  organisation   is  paying  for  is  actually what  they are getting from  their ISP.

You can achieve  this by monitoring  external  traffic.  External   traffic  is  generally  classified  as  anything  sent  over  a  Wide  Area Network   (WAN).  Anything  received  from  (or sent  to)  a network other  than your internal LAN   also qualifies  as external  traffic. The advantages  of monitoring  external  traffic include:

Internet  bandwidth  costs are justified by showing  actual usage,  and whether that  usage agrees with your ISP's  bandwidth  charges.  Future    capacity    needs    are    estimated    by   watching    usage    trends    and predicting  likely  growth  patterns.  Intruders  from  the  Internet  are  detected and filtered  before  they can cause problems.

Monitoring  this  traffic  is  easily  done  with  the  use of MRTG  on  an  SNMP enabled  device,  such  as  a  router.  If   your  router  does  not  support  SNMP, then  you  can  add  a switch  between  your  router  and  your  ISP  connection, and monitor  the port  traffic just as you would with an internal LAN.

##     Detecting network outages


With  monitoring  tools  in  place,  you  now have an accurate  measurement  of
how much  bandwidth  the organisation  is using. This measurement should agree with your ISP's bandwidth  charges. It  can  also  indicate  the  actual  throughput  of  your  connection  if  you  are using close to  your available capacity at peak times. A  "flat  top”  graph  is  a fairly  clear  indication  that  you  are  operating  at  full capacity.  The following  figure  NM  1 shows  flat  tops in  peak  outbound  traffic in  the middle of every day except Sunday.  It   is  clear  that  your  current   Internet  connection   is  overutilised   at  peak times, causing network lag.
After  presenting  this  information  to  the  Board,  you  can  make  a  plan  for further   optimising  your   existing   connection   (by   upgrading   your   proxy server and  using other techniques  in this  book)  and estimate  how soon you will need to upgrade your connection  to keep up with the demand.


This  is  also  an  excellent  time  to  review  your  operational  policy  with  the Board, and discuss ways to bring actual usage in line with that policy.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image140.png)


Later  in  the  week,  you  receive  an  emergency  phone  call  in  the  evening. Apparently,  no one in  the lab can  browse  the web or send  email. You  rush to the lab and hastily reboot  the proxy server, with no results. Browsing and email  are  still  broken.  You  then  reboot  the  router,  but  there  is  still  no success.  You  continue  eliminating  the  possible  fault  areas  one  by one  until you  realise  that  the network switch  is off - a loose  power cable is to  blame. After applying power, the network comes to life again.

How  can  you  troubleshoot  such  an  outage  without  such  time  consuming trial and  error?  Is  it  possible  to  be  notified  of outages  as  they occur,  rather than waiting for a user to complain?

One    way    to    do    this    is    to    use    a    program    such    as    Nagios 
(http://www.nagios.org/) that continually polls network devices and notifies you  of  outages.  Nagios  will  report  on  the  availability  of  various  machines and  services,  and  will  alert you  to  machines  that  have  gone  down.  In addition  to displaying  the network status graphically  on a web  page, it will send   notifications   via   SMS   or   email,   alerting   you   immediately   when problems arise.


With good  monitoring  tools  in  place, you will  be able to  justify  the cost of equipment  and bandwidth  by effectively demonstrating  how it is being used by the organisation. You are notified automatically  when  problems arise, and you have historical statistics  of  how  the  network  devices  are  performing.  You  can  check  the current  performance  against  this  history  to   find  unusual  behaviour,  and head off problems  before they become critical. When problems do come up, it is simple  to determine  the source and  nature  of the  problem.  Your  job  is easier,  the Board is satisfied,  and your users are much happier.

##     Monitoring your network

Managing  a  network  without  monitoring  is  similar  to  driving  a  vehicle without a speedometer or a fuel gauge.  How  do  you  know  how  fast  you  are  goings  Is  the  car  consuming  fuel  as efficiently  as  promised  by the  dealers?  If you  do an  engine  overhaul  several months later, is the car any faster or more efficient  than it was before?  Similarly,  how  can  you  pay  for  an  electricity  or  water  bill  without  seeing your monthly usage from a meter?  You  must  have  an  account  of your  network  bandwidth  utilisation  in  order to  justify  the  cost  of  services  and  hardware  purchases,  and  to  account  for usage trends.

There  are  several  benefits  to  implementing  a  good  monitoring  system  for your network:

 - Network  budget and resources are  justified.  Good monitoring  tools can  demonstrate  without  a  doubt  that  the  network  infrastructure (bandwidth,  hardware,  and software)  is suitable and able to handle the requirements of network  users.
 - Network  intruders   are  detected   and   Altered.   By  watching  your network   traffic,  you  can  detect  attackers   and  prevent   access   to critical internal servers and services.
 - Network  viruses  are  easily  detected.  You  can   be  alerted   to  the presence  of  
network  viruses,  and  take  appropriate  action   before they consume  Internet  bandwidth and destabilise your network.
 - Troubleshooting of  network  problems  is  greatly  simplified.  Rather than  attempting  ”trial  and  error”  to debug  network  problems,  you can   be   instantly   notified   of  specific   problems.   Some   kinds   of problems  can even be repaired  automatically.
 - Network  performance  can  be  highly  optimised.  Without  effective monitoring,  it  is impossible  to fine  tune your devices  and protocols to achieve  the best possible performance.
 - Capacity     planning     is     much     easier.     With     solid     historical 
performance   records,   you   do   not   have   to   ”guess”    how   much bandwidth  you will need as your network  grows.
 - Proper  network  usage can be enforced.  When bandwidth  is a scarce resource,  the  only  way  to  be  fair  to  all  users  is  to  ensure  that  the network  is being used for its intended purpose.

Fortunately,    network    monitoring    does    not    need   to    be   an   expensive  undertaking.   There  are  many  freely  available  open  source   tools  that  will show you exactly what  is happening on your network  in considerable  detail. This  section  will  help  you identify  many  invaluable  tools  and  how  best  to use them.

**The dedicated monitoring server**

While  monitoring  services  can  be  added  to  an  existing  network  server,  it  is often  desirable  to  dedicate  one  machine  (or  more,  if  necessary)  to  network monitoring.  Some applications  (such  as ntop http://www.ntop.org/) require considerable  resources  to run,  particularly  on a busy network. But  most  logging  and monitoring  programs  have  modest  RAM    and storage requirements,   typically  with  little  CPU    power  required.  Since  open  source operating  systems   (such   as   Linux   or   BSD)   make   very   efficient   use   of hardware    resources,    this   makes  it    possible    to    build    a   very    capable monitoring   server   from   recycled   PC   parts.   There   is   usually   no  need   to purchase a brand new server to relegate  to monitoring  duties. The exception  to this rule is in very large installations. If   your   network   includes   more   than   a   few   hundred   nodes,   or   if   you consume  more than 50 Mbps of Internet  bandwidth,  you will likely need to split  up monitoring  duties between  a few dedicated machines.

This  depends   largely  on  exactly  what   you  want   to   monitor.   If   you  are attempting  to  account  for  all  services  accessed  per  MAC     address,  this  will consume  considerably  more  resources  than simply  measuring  network  flows on  a  switch  port.  But  for  the  majority  of  installations,  a  single  dedicated monitoring   machine   is   usually   enough.While   consolidating   monitoring services  to  a single  machine  will  streamline  administration  and  upgrades,  it can   also   ensure   better   ongoing   monitoring. For   example,   if   you   install monitoring  services  on a web server,  and that web server develops  problems, then  your  network  may  not  be monitored  until  the problem  is resolved.  To a  network  administrator,  the  data  collected  about  network  performance  is nearly  as important as the network  itself.  Your  monitoring  should  be robust and  protected  from  service  outages  as  well  as  possible.  Without  network statistics,  you are effectively  blind to problems with the network.

Where does the server fit in your network?

If  you are only interested  in collecting  network flow statistics from a router, you can do this from just  about  anywhere on the LAN.
This provides  simple  feedback  about  utilisation,  but  cannot  give you  comprehensive  details  about  usage  patterns.  Figure  NM   2  below  shows  a  typical  MRTG  graph  generated  from the  Internet  router.  While  the  inbound  and  outbound  utilisation are  clear,  there  is  no  detail  about  which  computers,  users,  or protocols  are  using  bandwidth.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image141.png)

For   more   detail,   the   dedicated   monitoring   server   must   have   access   to everything  that  needs  to  be  watched. Typically,  this  means  it  must  have  access  to  the entire  network.  To  monitor  a  WAN    connection,  such  as  the  Internet  link  to  your  ISP,  the monitoring server  must  be  able  to  see  the  trafhc  passing  through  the  edge router.  To  monitor  a  LAN,  the  monitoring  server  is  typically  connected  to a   monitor   port   on   the   switch. If    multiple   switches   are   used   in   an installation,  the monitoring  server  may  need a connection  to  all of  them. That   connection   can   either   be   a   physical   cable,   or if   your   network switches  support  it,  a VLAN  specifically  configured  for  monitoring  traffic.


![](imageserver/uploadimages/image142.png)

If    monitor    port    functionality    is    not    available    on   your    switch,    the 
monitoring  server  may  be  installed  between  your  internal LAN   and  the Internet.  While  this  will  work,  it  introduces  a  single  point  of  failure  for the  network,   as  the  network  will  fail  if  the  monitoring  server  develops  a problem.  It  is  also  a  potential  performance  bottleneck,  if  the  server  cannot keep  up with  the demands  of  the network.


![](imageserver/uploadimages/image143.png)

A  better  solution  is  to  use  a  simple  network  hub  (not  a  switch)  which connects  the  monitoring   machine  to  the  internal  LAN,  external  router, and  the monitoring  machine.

While   this   does   still   introduce   an   additional   point   of   failure   to   the network (since  the  entire  network  will  be  unreachable  if  the  hub  dies), hubs  are generally considered  to  be much  more reliable  than  routers.

They  are  also  very  easily  replaced  should  they  fail.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image144.png)

Once  your  monitoring  server  is  in  place,  you  are  ready  to  start  collecting data.

**What  to monitor**

It is possible  to plot  just  about  any  network event and  watch  its  value  on a graph  over  time.  Since  every  network  is  slightly  different,   you  will  have  to  decide  what information   is   important   in   order   to   gauge   the   performance   of   your network. Here  are  some  important   indicators   that  many   network   administrators will typically  track.

**Wireless  statistics**

 - Received  signal  and  noise  from  all  backbone  nodes
 - Number  of  associated  stations
 - Detected  adjacent  networks  and  channels
 - Excessive  retransmissions
 - Radio  data  rate,  if  using  automatic  rate scaling

**Switch  statistics**

 - Bandwidth  usage  per switch  port
 - Bandwidth  usage  broken  down  by protocol
 - Bandwidth  usage  broken  down  by MAC  address
 - Broadcasts  as  a  percentage  of  total  packets
 - Packet  loss and  error  rate

**Internet statistics**

 - Internet  bandwidth  use  by host  and  protocol
 - Proxy server  cache  hits
 - Top  100 sites  accessed
 - DNS   requests
 - Number  of inbound  emails  / spam emails  / email  bounces
 - Outbound  email  queue  size
 - Availability  of critical  services  (web servers,  email  servers,  etc.).
 - Ping  times and  packet  loss  rates  to your  ISP
 - Status  of  backups

**System  health  statistics**

 - Memory  usage
 - Swap  file  usage
 - Process  count  /  zombie  processes
 - System  load
 - Uninterruptible Power Supply  (UPS)  voltage  and  load
 - Temperature,  fan  speed,  and  system  voltages
 - Disk SMART  status
 - RAID  array status

You   should   use   this   list   as   a   suggestion   of   where   to   begin.   As  your 
network   matures,   you  will   likely   find   new   key   indicators   of   network performance, and  you should  of course  track those as well.

There  are  many  freely  available  tools  that  will  show  you  as  much  detail  as you like about  what  is happening  on your  network. You   should   consider   monitoring   the   availability   of   any   resource   where unavailability  would adversely  affect  your  network  users. Don't   forget   to  monitor   the  monitoring   machine   itself,  for  example   its CPU      usage   and   disk   space,   in   order   to   receive   advance   warning   if   it becomes   overloaded   or   faulty.   A    monitoring    machine   that   is   low   on resources  can  affect  your  ability  to  monitor  the network  effectively.

##     Types of  monitoring  tools

We will now look  at several  different  classes  of  monitoring  tools.

1.   Network  detection  tools  listen  for  the  beacons  sent  by wireless  access points,  and  display  information  such  as  the  network  name,  received signal  strength,  and  channel.
2.  Spot   check   tools   are  designed  for   troubleshooting  and   normally   run 
interactively  for  short  periods  of  time.  A  program  such  as  ping  may  be considered  an  active  spot  check  tool,  since  it  generates  traffic  by polling a particular  machine.
3.  Passive  spot  check  tools  include  protocol  analysers,  which  inspect  every packet  on the  network  and  provide  complete  detail  about  any  network conversation    (including  source   and    destination    addresses,    protocol information,  and  even  application  data).
4. Trending  tools  perform  unattended  monitoring  over  long  periods,  and typically plot the results on a  graph.
5.  Throughput   testing   tools   tell   you   the   actual   bandwidth   available between  two points  on a  network.
6.    Realtime   monitoring   tools   perform  similar   monitoring,   but  notify administrators   immediately   if   they   detect   a   problem.    Intrusion detection  tools  watch  for  undesirable  or  unexpected  network  traffic, and    take    appropriate    action    (typically   denying    access    and/or notifying  a  network administrator).

##    Network  detection

The   simplest   wireless   monitoring   tools   simply   provide   a   list   of   available networks,  along  with  basic  information  (such  as  signal  strength  and channel). They  let  you  quickly  detect   nearby   networks   and   determine   if   they   are   in range  or  are  causing  interference.

**The built-in client.**

All    modern    operating    systems    provide    built-in    support    for    wireless 
networking.     Tits    typically    includes    the   ability   to   scan    for   available 
networks,    allowing   the   user   to   choose   a   network   from   a   list.   While virtually   all   wireless   devices   are   guaranteed   to  have   a   simple   scanning utility,  functionality  can  vary  widely  between  implementations. These  tools are  typically  only  useful  for  configuring   a  computer  in  a  home  or  office setting. They  tend  to  provide  little  information  apart  from  network  names  and  the
available  signal  to  the  access  point  currently  in  use.

**Netstumbler**

(http://www.wirelessdefence.org/Contents/NetstumblerMain.htm).   This   is the   most   popular   tool   for   detecting   wireless   networks   using   Microsoft Windows.  It  supports  a  variety  of  wireless  cards,  and  is  very  easy  to  use.  It will   detect   open   and   encrypted   networks,   but   cannot   detect   “closed” wireless   networks.   It   also  features   a   signal/noise   meter   that   plots   radio receiver  data  as  a  graph  over  time.  It  also  integrates  with  a  variety  of  GPS devices,  for  logging  precise  location  and  signal  strength  information.

This  makes Netstumbler  a handy  tool  to have  for  an  informal  site  survey. Macstumbler  (http://www.macstumbler.com/). While  not  directly  related  to the  Netstumbler,   Macstumbler   provides   much  of  the  same  functionality   but for  the Mac OS  X  platform.  It works  with  all Apple  Airport  cards.

##    Spot check tools

What  do  you  do when  the  network  breaks?  If you  can't  access  a  web  page or  email  server,  and  clicking  the  reload  button  doesn't  fix  the  problem, then  you'll  need  to  be able  to isolate  the exact location  of the problem.

These  tools  will  help  you  to  determine  just  where  a  connection  problem
exists.

This  section  is  simply  an  introduction   to  commonly  used  troubleshooting tools. For  more  discussion  of  common  network  problems  and  how  to  diagnose them,  see  the chapter  called  **Maintenance  and Troubleshooting**.

**ping**

Just  about  every  operating  system  (including  Windows,  Mac  OS  X,  and  of course   Linux   and   BSD)   includes   a   version   of   the   ping   utility.   It  uses ICMP  packets  to  attempt  to  contact   a  specified  host,  and  tells  you  how long  it  takes  to get  a  response.

Knowing  what   to  ping  is  just   as  important   as  knowing  how  to  ping.  If you find  that   you  cannot   connect   to   a   particular   service   in   your   web browser  (say, http://yahoo.com/), you could  try  to  ping  it:

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image145.png)

Hit   control-C  when  you are  finished  collecting  data.

If    packets   take   a   long   time   to   come   back,    there   may   be   network 
congestion.  If  return  ping  packets  have  an  unusually   low  Time  To  Live  (TTL),  you may  have  routing  problems  between  your  machine   and  the  remote  end. But what  if  the ping  doesn't  return  any  data at all?

If   you  are  pinging  a  name  instead  of  an  IP  address,  you  may  be  running into DNS   problems.

Try  pinging  an  IP  address  on  the  Internet.  If  you  can't  reach  it,  it's  a  good idea  to see  if  you can  ping  your  default  router:


![](imageserver/uploadimages/image146.png)


If   you can't  ping  your  default  router,  then  chances  are  you won't  be  able  to get  to  the  Internet  either.  If  you can't  even  ping  other  IP  addresses  on your local   LAN,   then   it's   time   to   check   your   connection.   If   you're   using Ethernet,  is  it plugged  in? If  you're  using  wireless,  are  you connected  to  the proper wireless  network,  and  is  it  in range?

While   it  is  generally   accurate   to  assume   that   a  machine   that   does   not respond  to  a  ping  is  likely  to  be  down  or  cut  off from  the  network  this  is not  always  100%  the case.  Particularly  on  a  WAN   or  the  Internet  itself,  it  is  also  possible  that  some  router/firewall  between  you  and   the  target   host(even   the  target  itself)   is blocking   pings.   If   you  find  a   machine   is  not   responding   to  pings,   try another  well-known  service  like ssh or http.

If  you can  reach  the  target  through  either  of  these  services  then  you know the  machine  is  up  and  simply  blocking  pings.  It  is  also  worth  noting  that different  systems  treat  ping  differently.  The classic  UNIX ping  utility  sends an   ICMP   ECHO   protocol   packet  to   the   target   host.   Some   network devices  will  respond  to  a  ping  automatically   regardless  of  whether  ICMP is  being  blocked  further  up the protocol  stack.  This  can   also  be   misleading   because   it  can   indicate   a  host   is  up  when actually  all  that's  really  going  on is  that  the NIC    (Network  Interface Card)  is  powered  and  the  machine  itself  is  not  actually  up  and  running.  As  we stated     above,    it's   always    good    to   check    connectivity    with   multiple methods.  Network   debugging  with  ping  is  a  bit  of  an  art,  but  it  is  useful to  learn.  Since  you  will  likely  find  ping  on  just   about  any  machine  you will work on,  it's  a  good idea  to learn how  to  use  it well.

**traceroute and mtr **

http://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/  

As  with  ping,  traceroute  is  found  on  most  operating  systems  (it's  called tracert  in   some  versions  of  Microsoft  Windows).  By  running  traceroute, you can  find  the  location  of  problems  between  your  computer  and  any point on the Internet:

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image147.png)

The -n switch  tells  traceroute  not  to  bother  resolving  names  in  DNS,  and makes  the  trace  run  more  quickly.  You  can  see  that  at  hop  seven,  the round  trip  time  shoots  up to  more  than  two  seconds,  while  packets  seem to  be discarded  at hop eight. This  might  indicate a problem  at that point in the network. If  this  part  of  the  network  is  in  your  control,  it  might  be  worth  starting your  troubleshooting effort  there.

My   TraceRoute   (mtr)   is   a   handy   program   that   combines   ping   and traceroute  into  a  single  tool.  By  running  mtr,  you  can  get  an  ongoing average   of   latency   and   packet   loss   to   a   single   host,   instead   of   the momentary snapshot  that ping and  traceroute  provide.

**My traceroute [v0.69]**

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image148.png)

The data will  be  continuously  updated  and  averaged  over  time. As  with  ping,  you  should  hit  control-C  when  you  are  finished  looking  at the data.  Note  that  you must  have  root  privileges  to  run  mtr. While  these  tools  will not  reveal  precisely  what  is wrong  with  the  network, they   can   
give   you   enough    information    to   know   where    to   continue troubleshooting.


##    Protocol  analysers

Network    protocol    analysers    provide    a    great    deal    of    detail    about 
information   flowing   through   a   network,   by   allowing   you   to   inspect individual  packets.   For  wired   networks,  you  can  inspect   packets  at  the data-link    layer    or    above.    For    wireless    networks,    you    can    inspect information   all  the   way   down to   individual   802.11  frames.   Here   are several  popular  (and  free)  network  protocol  analysers:

**Kismet**

http://www.kismetwireless.net/ Kismet    is   a   powerful   wireless    protocol   analyser    for   many   platforms including  Linux,  Mac  OS   X,   and  even  the  embedded  OpenWRT  Linux distribution.  It  works  with  any  wireless  card  that  supports  passive  monitor mode.  In  addition  to  basic  network  detection, Kismet  will  passively  log  all 802.11  frames  to  disk  or  to  the  network  in  standard  PCAP  format,  for later   analysis   with  tools   like  Wireshark.   Kismet   also   features   associated client   information,   AP   hardware   fingerprinting,  Netstumbler   detection, and  GPS    integration.  Since  it  is  a  passive   network   monitor,   it  can  even detect   “closed”   wireless   networks   by   analysing    traffic   sent   by   wireless clients.  You  can  run  Kismet  on  several  machines  at  once,  and  have  them all report  over  the  network  back  to  a  central  user interface.   This  allows  for wireless  monitoring   over   a  large  area,   such  as   a   university  or   corporate campus.  Since  Kismet  uses  the  radio  card's  passive  monitor  mode,  it  does all of  this  without  transmitting  any  data. Kismet  is  an  invaluable  tool  for diagnosing  wireless  network  problems.

**KisMAC**

http://kismac-ng.org

Exclusively  for  the  Mac  OS  X  platform,   KisMAC  does  much  of  what Kismet   can  do,  but  with  a  slick  Mac  OS  X  graphical  interface.  It  is  a passive  scanner  that will log  data  to disk in  PCAP  format  compatible  with Wireshark.  It supports  passive  scanning with  AirportExtreme  cards  as  well as  a variety  of USB  wireless  adapters.

**tcpdump**

help://www.tcpdump.org/

tcpdump  is a  command-line  tool for  monitoring  network  traffic. It  does  not  have  all  the  bells   and  whistles  of  wireshark   but  it  does   use fewer resources.  Tcpdump   can  capture   and  display   all  network  protocol information  down  to  the  link  layer.  It  can  show  all  of  the  packet  headers and  data  received,  or just  the packets  that  match  particular  criteria. Packets  captured   with  tcpdump  can   be  loaded  into  wireshark   for  visual analysis  and  further  diagnostics.  This  is  very  useful  if  you wish  to  monitor an   interface  on  a   remote   system  and   bring   the  file   back   to  your   local machine  for  analysis.  The  tcpdump tool  is  available  as  a  standard  tool  in Unix  derivatives  (Linux,  BSD,  and Mac  OS  X).  There  is  also  a  Windows port  called  WinDump  available  at   http://www.winpcap.org/windump/

**Wireshark**

http://www.wireshark.org/

Formerly known  as  Ethereal,  Wireshark  is a free network  protocol  analyser for Unix and Windows.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image149.png)

Wireshark  allows  you  to  examine   data  from   a  live  network  or  from   a capture  file  on  disk,  and  interactively  browse  and  sort  the  captured  data. Both   summary   and   detailed   information   is   available   for   each   packet, including  the full  header  and  data portions.


Wireshark   has   several   powerful   features,   including   a   rich   display   filter language  and   the   ability   to   view   the   reconstructed   stream   of   a   TCP session.

It  can  be  daunting  to  use  for  first  time  users  or  those  that  are  not  familiar with  the OSI   layers. It  is  typically  used  to  isolate  and  analyse  specific  traffic  to  or  from  an  IP address,  but  it can  be  also  used  as  a  general  purpose  fault  finding  tool.  For example, a   machine   infected   with   a   network   worm   or   virus   can   be identified  by  looking  for  the  machine  that  is  sending  out  the  same  sort  of TCP/IP  packets  to large  groups  of IP  addresses.

##     Trending  tools

Trending   tools   are   used   to  see   how  your   network   is  used   over   a  long period   of   time.   They   work   by   periodically   monitoring    your   network activity,  and  displaying  a  summary  in  a  human-readable  form  (such  as  a graph).  Trending  tools  collect data as  well  as  analyse  and  report  on it.

Below  are  some examples  of trending  tools.  Some  of  them need  to  be  used in conjunction  with  each  other,  as  they  are  not  stand-alone  programs.

**MRTG**

http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/

The  Multi  Router  Traffic  Grapher  (MRTG)  monitors  the  traffic  load  on network  links  using  SNMP.  MRTG  generates  graphs  that  provide  a  visual representation   of   inbound    and    outbound    traffic.    Use       are    typically displayed  on a web page.

MRTG  can  be  a little  confusing  to set  up, especially if you are  not familiar with   SNMP.    But   once   it   is   installed,    MRTG   requires   virtually   no maintenance,   unless  you  change  something  on  the  system  that  is  being monitored  (such  as its IP address).

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image150.png)

**RRDtool**

RRD  is  short  for  Round  Robin  Database.  RRD  is  a  database  that  stores information   in   a   very   compact   way  that   does   not   expand   over   time. RRDtool  refers  to  a  suite  of  tools  that  allow  you  to  create  and  modify RRD databases,  as well as generate  useful  graphs  to  present  the data. It  is  used  to  keep  track  of  time-series  data  (such  as  network  bandwidth, machine  room   temperature,  or  server  load  average)  and  can  display  that data as  an  average over  time.

Note   that   RRDtool   itself  does   not   contact   network   devices   to  retrieve data.  It is merely  a database  manipulation  tool. You  can  use  a  simple  wrapper  script  (typically  in  shell  or  Perl)  to  do  that work  for you.  RRDtool  is  also  used  by many  full  featured  front-ends  that present   you  with  a  friendly  web  interface  for  configuration   and  display. RRD    graphs  give  you  more  control over  display  options  and  the  number of items available  on a  graph  as compared  to MRTG.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image151.png)

RRHtool  is included  in  virtually  all  modern  Linux  distributions,  and  can be  downloaded  from  http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/

**ntop**

For   historical   traffic  analysis   and    usage,   you   will   certainly   want   to 
investigate  ntop.  This   program   builds   a   detailed   real-time   report   of  observed   network traffic, displayed   in   your   web   browser.   It  integrates   with   rrdtool,   and makes graphs  and charts  visually depicting  how the network is being used. On  very  busy  networks,  ntop  can use  a  lot of  CPU  and  disk space,  but  it gives you extensive insight  into how your network is being  used. It runs  on Linux,  BSD,  Mac OS X, and Windows.

Some  of its  more  useful  features  include:

Traffic   display   can   be   sorted   by   various   criteria   (source,   destination, protocol, MAC address,  etc.).

Traffic statistics  grouped  by protocol  and  port  number.

An  IP  traffic  matrix  which  shows  connections  between  machines  Network flows   for routers   or  switches   that  support   the   NetFlow   protocol   Host operating   system identification,   P2P   traffic,    identification,   numerous graphical  charts,  Perl,  PHP,  and Python API.

ntop   is   available   from   http://www.ntop.org/   and   is   available   for   most
operating  systems.  It  is  often  included  in  many  of  the  popular  Linux  distributions,  including RedHat,  Debian,  and  Ubuntu.

While  it  can  be  left  running  to  collect  historical  data,  ntop  can  be  fairly CPU   intensive,  depending on the amount  of traffic observed.

If  you  are  going  to  run  it  for  long  periods  you  should  monitor  the  CPU utilisation  of the monitoring  machine.


![](imageserver/uploadimages/image152.png)

The  main  disadvantage  of  ntop  is  that  it  does  not  provide  instantaneous
information,  only  long-term  totals  and  averages.  This   can   make   it   difhcult    to   use   to   diagnose   a   problem   that   starts suddenly.

**Cacti**

http://www.cacti.net/

Cacti  is a front-end  for  RRDtool.  It stores  all of  the necessary  information to create  graphs  in a  MySQL  database.  The front-end  is written  in  PHP.

Cacti  does  the  work  of  maintaining  graphs,  data  sources,  and  handles  the actual  data gathering.  There   is  support  for  SNMP  devices,  and   custom   scripts  can   easily  be written  to  poll virtually  any conceivable  network event.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image153.png)


Cacti   can   be   somewhat   confusing   to   configure,   but   once   you   work through   the  documentation   and   examples,   it  can  yield  very  impressive graphs. There  are  hundreds  of  templates  for  various  systems  available  on  the  cacti website,  and the code  is  under  rapid development.

**NetFlow**

NetFlow  is  a  protocol  for  collecting   IP  traffic  information   invented   by Cisco. From  the Cisco website:

Cisco   IOS   NetFlow   efhciently   provides   a   key   set   of   services   for   IP 
applications,   including  network  traffic  accounting,   usage-based   network billing,    network    planning,    security,    Denial    of    Service    monitoring capabilities,  and  network  monitoring. NetFlow    provides    valuable    information    about    network    users    and applications,   peak  usage  times,  and  traffic  routing.

Cisco  routers  can  generate  NetFlow  information  which  is  available  from the   router   in   the   form   of   UDP    packets.   NetFlow   is   also   less   CPU- intensive   on   Cisco   routers   than   using   SNMP.   It   also   provides   more granular  information  than  SNMP,  letting  you  get  a  more  detailed  picture of  port  and   protocol   usage.This   information  is  collected   by  a  NetFlow collector  that stores  and  presents  the data as  an  aggregate  over  time.  By  analysing  flow  data,  one  can  build  a  picture  of  traffic  flow  and  traffic volume  in a  network  or  on  a  connection.  There  are  several  commercial and  free  NetFlow collectors  available.  Ntop  is  one  free  tool  that  can  act  as a  NetFlow  collector  and  probe.  
Another  is  Flowc  (see  below).  It  can  also be  desirable  to  use  Netflow  as  a spot  check  tool,  by just  looking at a quick snapshot   of   data   during   a   network   crisis.   Think  of   NetFlow   as   an alternative   to   SNMP   for   Cisco   devices.   For   more   information  about NetFlow,  see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflow

**Flowc**

http://netacad.kiev.ua/flowc/.  Flowc  is  an  open  source  NetFlow  collector (see  NetFlow  above).  It  is  lightweight  and  easy  to  configure.  Flowc  uses  a MySQL  database  to  store  aggregated   traffic  information.  Therefore,   it  is possible  to generate  your  own  reports  from  the data  using SQL,  or  use  the included  report  generators.  The  built-in  report  generators  produce  reports in  HTML,  plain  text or a graphical  format.


![](imageserver/uploadimages/image154.png)

The  large  gap  in  data  probably  indicates  a  network  outage. Trending  tools typically will  not  notify you of outages,  but  merely log the occurrence. To  be  notified  when  network  problems  occur,  use  a  realtime  monitoring tool such  as  Nagios.

**SmokePing**

http://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/.      SmokePing      is      a      deluxe      latency measurement  tool written  in  Perl.  It  can  measure,   store  and  display  latency,  latency  distribution  and  packet loss all on a single  graph. SmokePing    uses   the   RRDtool   for   data   storage,    and   can   draw   very informative  graphs  that  present  up  to  the  minute  information  on  the  state of your  network  connection.

It  is  very  useful  to  run  SmokePing  on  a  host  with  good  connectivity  to your  entire  network.  Over  time,  trends  are  revealed  that  can  point  to  all sorts  of network problems.  Combined  with  MRTG  or  Cacti,  you  can  observe  the  effect  that  network congestion  has on packet loss and latency.

SmokePing  can  optionally  send  alerts  when  certain  conditions   are  met, such  as  when  excessive  packet  loss is seen  on a  link for  an extended  period of  time. An example  of SmokePing in action  is shown  in  Figure  NM  12.


![](imageserver/uploadimages/image155.png)

**EtherApe**

http://etherape.sourceforge.net/
EtherApe  displays  a  graphical  representation  of  network  traffic.  Hosts  and links  change  size  depending   on  the  amount  of  traffic  sent  and  received. The colours  change  to  represent  the protocol  most  used.  As with  wireshark and   tcpdump,  data  can  be  captured   "off  the  wire”  from   a  live  network connection   or  read  from   a  tcpdump  capture   file.  EtherApe  doesn't  show quite  as  much  detail  as  ntop,  but  its  resource  requirements  are  much  lighter.

**iptraf**

http://iptraf.seul.org/ 

IPTraf   is  a  lightweight   but   powerful   LAN   monitor.   It  has   an   ncurses interface  and  runs  in  a  command  shell. IPTraf takes  a  moment  to  measure observed   traffic,   and   then   displays   various   network  statistics   including TCP  and  UDP  connections,  ICMP  and  OSPF  information,  traffic  flows, IP  checksum  errors,  and  more.  It  is  a  simple  to  use  program   that  uses minimal  system  resources. While  it does  not  keep  historical  data,  it 
is  very useful  for displaying  an  instantaneous  usage  report.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image156.png)

**Agrus**

http://qosient.com/argus/.

Argus  stands  for  Audit  Record  Generation  and  Utilisation  System.  Argus is  also  the  name  of  the  mythological  Greek  god who  had  hundreds  of eyes.

*From the Argus website: *

Argus  generates  flow  statistics  such  as  connectivity,  capacity,  demand,  loss, delay,  and  jitter  on  a  per  transaction   basis.  Argus  can  be  used  to  analyse and   report   on   the  contents   of   packet   capture   files   or   it   can   run   as   a continuous   monitor,  examining  data  from  a  live  interface;  generating   an audit  log  of all  the network  activity  seen  in  the packet  stream.  Argus   can   be  deployed   to  monitor   individual  end-systems,   or  an  entire enterprises   network   activity.   As   a   continuous   monitor,   Argus   provides both  push  and  pull  data handling  models,   to  allow  flexible  strategies  for collecting    network   audit   data.    Argus   data   clients   support   a   range   of operations,    such   as   sorting,   aggregation,    archival   and   reporting.   Argus consists  of  two  parts:  a  master  collector that  reads  packets  from  a  network device,   and   a  client   that  connects   to   the  master   and   displays  the   usage statistics.  Argus  runs  on BSD,  Linux,  and most  other  UNIX systems.

**NeTraMet**

http://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/netramet/ NeTraMet  is  another  popular  flow  analysis  tool.  Like  Argus,  NeTraMet   consists   of   two   parts:   a   collector   that   gathers   statistics   via SNMP, and  a  manager  that  specifies  which  flows  should  be  watched.  Flows  are  specified  using  a simple  programming  language  that  defines  the addresses   used  on   either   end,   and   can   include   Ethernet,   IP,   protocol information,    or   other   identifiers.   NeTraMet   runs   on   DOS     and   most UNIX systems,  including  Linux  and  BSD.

##    Throughput  testing

How  fast  can  the network  go? What  is  the actual  usable capacity  of a particular  network  link?  You  can  get  a  very  good  estimate  of  your  throughput  capacity  by flooding the  link with   traffic  and  measuring  how  long  it  takes  to  transfer  the data.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image157.png)

While  there  are  web  pages  available  that  will  perform  a  “speed  test”  in  your browser  (such  as  http://www.dslreports.com/stest  or http://speedtest.net/), these  tests  are  increasingly   inaccurate  as  you  get  further  from  the  testing source.  Even worse,  they do not  allow  you to test  the speed  of a given  link, but  only  the speed of your  link  to  a particular  site on the Internet.  Here  are  a  few  tools  that  will  allow  you  to perform  throughput  testing  on your  own  networks.

**ttcp**

Now  a  standard  part  of  most  Unix-like  systems,  ttcp  is  a  simple  network performance  testing tool. One  instance  is  run  on  either  side of  the link you want  to  test. The first  node  runs in  receive  mode,  and  the other transmits:

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image158.png)

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image159.png)

After  collecting  data  in  one  direction,  you  should  reverse  the  transmit  and receive  partners  to  test  the  link  in  the  other  direction.  It  can  test  UDP     as well  as  TCP  streams,   and  can  alter  various   TCP     parameters   and   buffer lengths   to   give   the   network   a   good  workout.   It   can   even   use  a   user- supplied  data  stream  instead  of  sending  random  data.  Remember  that  the speed  readout  is  in  kilobytes,  not  kilobits.  Multiply  the  result  by  8  to  find the  speed  in  kilobits  per  second.  The  only real  disadvantage  to  ttcp  is  that it  hasn't  been  developed  in  years.  Fortunately,   the code  has  been  released in  the  public domain  and is  freely  available.  Like  ping  and  traceroute,  ttcp is  found  as  a standard  tool on many  systems.

**iperf**

http://iperf.sourceforge.net/. Much  like  ttcp,  iperf  is  a  command  line  tool for  estimating  the  throughput  of  a  network  connection.  It  supports  many of  the  same  features  as   ttcp,  but  uses  a  “client”  and  “server”  model  instead of a  “receive”  and  “transmit”  pair. To  run  iperf,  launch  a server  on one  side and  a client  on the other:

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image160.png)



The  server  side  will  continue   to  listen  and  accept  client  connections   on port  5001  until  you  hit  control-C  to  kill  it.  This  can  make  it  handy  when running  multiple  test runs  from  a  variety  of locations.  The  biggest  difference  between  ttcp  and  iperf  is  that  iperf  is  under  active development,   and  has  many  new  features  (including  IPv6  support).   This makes   it   a   good   choice   as   a   performance    tool   when   building    new networks.


**bing**

http://fgouget.free.fr/bing/indx-en.shtml
Rather  than  flood  a  connection   with  data  and  see  how  long  the  transfer takes  to  complete,  bing  attempts  to  estimate  the  available  throughput  of  a point-to-point  connection  by  analysing  round  trip  times  for  various  sized ICMP  packets.  While   it  is  not  always  as  accurate   as  a  flood  test,   it  can provide  a  good estimate  without  transmitting  a  large  number  of  bytes. Since   bing   works   using   standard   ICMP   echo   requests,   it  can   estimate available  bandwidth  without  the  need  to  run  a  special  client  on  the  other end,   and  can   even   attempt   to  estimate   the  throughput   of   links   outside your  network.  Since  it  uses  relatively  little  bandwidth,  bing  can  give  you  a rough  idea of network  performance  without  running  up  the  charges  that  a flood  test  would certainly  incur.

##   Realtime tools and intrusion  detection

It   is   desirable   to   find  out   when   people   are   trying   to   break   into   your 
network,  or when  some part  of the network  has  failed. Because   no  system   administrator   can   be   monitoring   a   network   all   the time,  there are programs  that  constantly  monitor  the status  of  the  network and  can  send alerts when  notable  events occur.

The following  are some open  source  tools  that can  help  perform  this  task.

**Snort**

Snort  (http://www.snort.org/)  is  a  packet  sniffer  and  logger  which  can  be used as  a  lightweight  network  intrusion  detection  system. It  features  rule-based  logging  and  can  perform  protocol  analysis,  content searching,  and   packet  matching.

It  can  be  used  to  detect  a  variety  of  attacks  and  probes,  such  as  stealth port   
scans,   CGI     attacks,   SMB    probes,   OS    fingerprinting  attempts,   and many other kinds  of anomalous  trafhc patterns.  Snort  has  a  real-time  alert  capability  that  can  notify  administrators  about problems  as  they occur  with  a  variety  of methods.  Installing  and  running  Snort  is  not  trivial,  and  depending  on  the  amount of network  traffic,  will  likely  require  a  dedicated  monitoring  machine  with considerable  resources.

Fortunately,    Snort    is    very    well   documented    and    has    a   strong   user 
community. By   implementing    a   comprehensive    Snort    rule   set,    you   can    identify unexpected  behaviour   that   would   otherwise   mysteriously   eat   up   your Internet  bandwidth.  See    http://snort.org/docs/    for    an    extensive    list    of    installation     and configuration  resources.

**Apache:  mod_security**

ModSecurity   (http://www.modsecurity.org/)  is   an   open   source   intrusion detection  and  prevention  engine  for  web  applications.
This  kind  of security  tool  is  also  known  as  a web  application  firewall.  ModSecurity     increases    web    application     security    by    protecting    web applications  from  known  and  unknown  attacks. It  can   be   used   on  its   own,   or   as   a   module   in   the  Apache  web   server (http://www.apache.org/).

There  are  several  sources  for  updated  mod_security  rules  that  help  protect against  the  latest  security  exploits. One     excellent    resource    is    GotRoot,    which    maintains    a    huge    and  frequently  updated  repository  of rules: 
http://www.atomicorp.com/wiki/index.php/AtomicpModSecuritypRules Web  application  security  is important  in defending  against  attacks  on your web  server,  which  could  result  in  the   theft  of  valuable  or  personal  data,  or in  the  server  being  used  to  launch  attacks  or   send  spam  to  other  Internet users.   As   well   as   being   damaging    to   the   Internet   as   a   whole,   such intrusions  can  seriously  reduce  your  available  bandwidth.

**Nagios**

Nagios  (http://nagios.org/)  is  a  program   that  monitors  hosts  and  services on your  network,  notifying  you immediately  when  problems  arise. It  can  send  notifications  via  email,  SMS,  or  by  running  a  script,  and  will send  notifications  to  the  relevant  person  or  group  depending  on  the nature of   the   problem.  Nagios   runs   on   Linux   or   BSD,   and   provides   a   web interface   to   show   up-to-the-minute  system   status.   Nagios   is  extensible, and  can  monitor   the  status  of  virtually   any  network  event.  It  performs checks  by  running  small  scripts  at  regular  intervals,  and  checks  the  results against  an  expected  response.

This  can  yield  much  more  sophisticated   checks   than  a  simple  network probe.  For  example,  ping  may  tell  you  that  a  machine  is  up,  and  nmap may  report  that  a  TCP   port  responds  to  requests,  but  Nagios  can  actually retrieve   a   web   page   or   make   a database   request,   and   verify   that   the response  is not an  error.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image161.png)

Nagios  can  even  notify  you  when  bandwidth  usage,  packet  loss,  machine room  temperature,  or  other  network  health  indicator  crosses  a  particular threshold. This  can  give  you  advance  warning  of  network  problems,  often  allowing you to  respond  to  the problem  before  users have a chance  to complain.

**Zabbix**

Zabbix   (http://www.zabbix.org/)   is  an   open   source   realtime   monitoring tool  that  is  something  of  a  hybrid  between   Cacti  and  Nagios.  It  uses  a SQL    database  for  data  storage,  has  its  own  graph  rendering  package,  and performs  all  of  the  functions  you  would  expect  from  a  modern  realtime monitor    (such    as    SNMP    polling    and    instant    notification    of    error conditions).  Zabbix  is  released  under  the  GNU   General  Public License.


##   Other  useful tools

There   are   thousands   of   free   network   monitoring    tools    that   fill   very 
specialised  needs.  Here  are  a  few  of  our  favourites  that  don't  quite  fit  into the  above  categories.

**ngrep**

Ngrep   provides   most   of   GNU     grep's   pattern   matching   features,    but applies   them   to  network   traffic.   It  currently   recognises   IPv4   and   IPv6, TCP,   UDP,   ICMP, IGMP,   PPP,   SLIP,   FDDI,   Token   Ring,   and   much
more.  As  it  makes  extensive  use  of   regular  expression  matches,  it  is  a  tool suited  to  advanced  users  or  those  that  have  a  good  knowledge  of  regular expressions.  You  don't  necessarily  need  to  be  a  regex  expert  to  be  able  to make  basic  use  of  ngrep.  For  example,  to  view  all  packets  that  contain  the string  GET    (presumably  HTTP requests),  try  this:


```
#  ngrep  -q GET
```

Pattern  matches  can  be  constrained  further  to  match  particular  protocols, ports,  or  other criteria  using  BPF  filters.  This  is  the filter  language  used  by common  packet  sniffing  tools,  such  as  tcpdump  and  snoop. To  view  GET or  POST strings sent to destination  port 80, use this command  line:

```
#  ngrep  -q  'GET|POST' port  80
```

By  using  ngrep  creatively,   you  can  detect  anything  from  virus  activity  to spam  email.  You  can  download  ngrep  at http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/.

**nmap/Zenmap**

nmap  is  a  network  diagnostic  tool  for  showing   the  state  and  availability  of network   ports  on  a  network   interface.  A   common  use  is  to  scan  a  network host  on  a  TCP/IP  network  for  what  ports  are  open,  thereby  allowing  one  to create  a  ”map”  of  the  network  services  that  the  machine  provides.  The  nmap tool  does   this   by  sending  specially  crafted  packets  to  a  target   network  host and  noticing  the  response(s).  For  example,  a web  server  with  an  open  port  80 but  no  running  web  server  will  respond  differently   to  an  nmap  probe   than one  that  not  only  has  the  port open  but  is  running  httpd.  Similarly,  you will  get  a  different  response  to  a  port  that  is simply  shut  off vs.  one  that  is open  on a host  but  blocked  by a  firewall.

Over   time,   nmap   has   evolved   from    being   a   simple   port-scanner   to something  that  can  detect  OS   versions,  network  drivers,   the  type  of  NIC hardware   being  used  by  an  interface,  driver   versions,   etc.  In  addition   to scanning  individual   machines,  it  can  also  scan  entire  networks   of  hosts. This  does  mean  that  nmap  is  potentially  also  useful  by  malicious  network users  as   a  way   to   ”scope  out"   a  system   before   attacking   it.  Like  many diagnostic    tools,    nmap    can    be    used    for    good   or  ill    and    network administrators  would  do  well  to  be  aware  of  both  sides.  The  nmap  tool  is released   under   the  GPL    license   and   the  latest   version   can   be  found  at *http://www.nmap.org*.

**Zenmap**

Zenmap   is  a  cross-platform   GUI  for   nmap  which   runs   under  Linux, Windows,   Mac   OS   X,   BSD,   etc.   and   can   be   downloaded   from   the nmap.org site as well.

**netcat**

Somewhat  between  **nmap**  and  **tcpdump**,  **netcat**  is  another  diagnostic  tool for  poking  and  prodding  at  ports  and  connections  on  a  network.  It  takes its  name  from  the  UNIX  **cat(1)**  utility,  which  simply  reads  out  whatever file   you   ask   it   to.   Similarly,  netcat   reads   and   writes   data   across   any arbitrary  TCP    or  UDP    port.  The netcat  utility  is  not  a packet  analyser  but works  on  the data(payload)  contained  in  the packets.  For  example,  here  is  how  to  run  a  very  simple   l-line,   l-time  web  server with  
netcat:

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image162.png)

The file  Some.file will be  sent  to  the first  host  that  connects  to port  8080 on the system  running  netcat.  The -1 command  tells  netcat  to  "listen”  on port  8080 and  wait  until  it  gets a connection.  Once  it  does,  it  stops  blocking,  reads  the  data  off  the  pipe  and  sends  it  to the  client  connected  on  port  8080.  Some  other  good  examples  of  netcat usage  can  be  found  in  the Wikipedia  entry for  netcat: 

https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Netcat#Examples

You  can  download  the  latest  version  of netcat  from http://nc110.sourceforge.net/ It is  available  under  a Permissive  Free  Software  License.


##   What  is normal?


If   you  are  looking  for  a  definitive  answer  as  to  what  your  traffic  patterns should  look  like,  you  are  going  to  be  disappointed.  There  is  no  absolute right   answer   to   this   question,   but   given  some  work  you  can   determine what   is  normal  for  your  network.  While  every  environment   is  different, some   of   the   factors   that   can   influence   the   appearance   of   your   traffic patterns  are:

 - The capacity  of your  Internet  connection
 - The number  of users  that  have  access  to  the  network  
 - The social  policy  (byte  charging,  quotas,  honour  system,  etc.).
 - The  number,  types,  and  level  of services  offered
 - The    health    of    the    network    (presence    of    viruses,    excessive  broadcasts,   routing   loops,   open   email   relays,   denial   of   service attacks, etc.).
 - The competence  of your  computer  users
 - The  location   and   configuration   of  control   structures   (firewalls, proxy servers,  caches,  and  so on)

This  is  not  a  definitive  list,  but  should  give  you  an  idea  of  how  a  wide range of factors  can  affect  your  bandwidth  patterns. With this  in  mind, let's look  at  the topic of  baselines.

##    Establishing  a baseline

Since  every  environment   is  different,   you  need  to  determine  for  yourself what  your  traffic  patterns  look  like  under  normal  situations.  This  is  useful because   it   allows   you   to   identify   changes   over   time,   either   sudden   or gradual.   These   changes   may  in  turn  indicate   a  problem,   or   a  potential future  problem,  with  your  network. For  example,  suppose  that  your  network  grinds  to  a  halt,  and  you  are  not sure   of   the   cause.   Fortunately,   you   have   decided   to   keep   a   graph   of broadcasts   as   a percentage   of  the  overall   network   traffic.   If   this   graph shows  a  sudden  increase in  the  amount  of  broadcast   traffic,  it  may  mean that  your  network  has  been  infected  with  a virus. Without  an  idea  of  what  is  ”normal"   for  your  network  (a  baseline),  you would  not   be able  to  see  that  the  number  of  broadcasts   had   increased, only  that  it was  relatively  high,  which  may  not  indicate  a problem.  Baseline  graphs  and  figures  are  also  useful  when  analysing   the  effects  of changes  made  to  the  network.   It  is  often  very  useful  to  experiment  with such   changes   by   trying   different    possible    values.   Knowing   what    the baseline   looks   like  will  show  you  whether   your   changes   have  improved matters,  or  made  them worse.


![](imageserver/uploadimages/image163.png)

In  Figure  NM    16,  we  can  see  the  effect  of  the  implementation  of  delay
pools  on Internet  utilisation  around  the period of  May. If  we  did  not  keep  a  graph  of  the  line  utilisation,  we  would  never  know what  the  effect  of  the  change  over  the  long  term  was. When  watching  a  total  trafhc  graph  after  making  changes,   don't  assume that  just   because  the  graph  does  not  change  radically  that  your  efforts  were wasted.   You  might   have   removed  frivolous   usage  from  your  line  only  to have  it  replaced  by genuine  legitimate  traffic.
You   could   then   combine   this   baseline   with   others,   say   the   top   100   sites accessed  or  the  average  utilisation  by  your   top  twenty  users,  to  determine  if habits  have  simply  changed.  As we  will see  later,  MRTG,  RRDtool,  and  Cacti are  excellent  tools   you can  use  to  keep  a  baseline.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image164.png)

Figure  NM    17  shows  traffic  on  an  Aidworld  firewall  over  a  period  of  24 hours.  There  is  nothing  apparently  wrong  with  this  graph,  but  users  were complaining  about  slow  Internet  access.  Figure  NM    18  shows   that  the  upload   bandwidth   use  (blue)   was  higher during  working hours  on  the  last  day  than  on  previous  days.  A  period  of heavy   upload   usage   started  every  morning   at   03:00,   and   was  normally finished  by 09:00,  but  on the last  day  it was still  running  at  16:30.  Further investigation   revealed  a  problem  with  the  backup  software,   which  ran  at 03:00  every day.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image165.png)

Figure  NM    19  shows  measurements  of  latency  on  the  same  connection  as measured   by   the   program   called   SmokePing.   The  position   of   the  dots shows  the  average  latency,  while  the  grey  smoke  indicates  the  distribution of  latency   (jitter).   The  colour  of  the  dots   indicates   the  number  of  lost packets.  This  graph  over  a  period  of  four   hours  does  not  help  to  identify whether  there are  any  problems  on the  network.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image166.png)

The  next  graph  (Figure  NM    20)  shows  the  same  data  over  a  period  of  16 hours.  This  indicates  that  the  values  in  the  graph  above  are  close  to  the normal  level  (baseline), but  that  there  were  significant  increases  in  latency at  several   times  during   the  early  morning,   up  to  30  times   the  baseline value.
This   indicates   that   additional   monitoring   should   be   performed   during these  periods  to  establish  the  cause  of  the  high  latency  to  avoid  problems such  as  the  backup  not  completing  in  the future.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image167.png)

Figure  NM  21 shows  that Tuesday  was significantly  worse  than  Sunday  or Monday  for latency,  especially during the early morning  period. This  might  indicate  that something  has  changed  on the  network.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image168.png)

**How do I  interpret  the  traffic graph?**

In  a  basic  network  flow  graph  (such  as  that  generated   by  the  network monitor  tool  MRTG),  the  green  area  indicates  inbound  traffic,  while  the blue   line   indicates  outbound    traffic.   Inbound    traffic   is   traffic   that originates  from  another  network  (typically  the  Internet)  and  is  addressed to  a   computer   inside   your   network.   Outbound   traffic  is traffic that originates  from  your  network,  and  is addressed  to a  computer  somewhere on  the  Internet.  Depending  on  what  sort  of  network  environment  you have,  the  graph  will  help  you  understand  how  your  network  is  actually being   used.    For  example,   monitoring   of  servers   usually   reveals   larger amounts  of  outbound  traffic  as  the  servers  respond  to  requests  (such  as sending  mail  or  serving  web  pages),  while  monitoring   client   machines might  reveal  higher  amounts  of  inbound traffic to  the  machines  as  they receive  data from  the servers.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image169.png)

Traffic  patterns  will  vary  with what  you are  monitoring.

A router  will normally show more incoming  traffic than  outgoing  traffic as users download  data from  the Internet. An  excess  of  outbound   traffic  that  is  not  transmitted  by  your  network servers  may  indicate  a  peer-to-peer  client, unauthorised  server,  or  even  a virus on one or  more of your  clients.

There  are  no  set  metrics   that  indicate  what   outgoing  traffic   to  incoming
traffic should  look  like. It  is  up  to  you  to  establish  a  baseline  to  understand  what  normal  network traffic patterns  look  like on your network.

**Detecting network overload**

Figure  NM 23 shows  traffic  on an  overloaded  Internet connection.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image170.png)

The  most  apparent  sign  of overloading  is  the  flat  tops  on  outbound  traffic during  the  middle  of every day. Flat   tops   may   indicate   overloading,    even   if   they   are   well   below   the maximum  theoretical  capacity  of  the  link. In  this  case  it  may  indicate  that  you  are  not  getting  as  much  bandwidth from  your  service  provider  as  you expect.

**Measuring 95th percentile**

The  95th  percentile  is  a  widely  used  mathematical  calculation  to  evaluate regular  and  sustained  utilisation  of a  network  pipe. Its value  shows  the highest  consumption  of traffic  for a given  period. Calculating  the  95th percentile  means  that  95%  of  the  time  the  usage  is below  a  certain  amount,  and  5%  of the  time  usage  is above  that  amount.  The  95th  percentile  is  a  good  guideline  to  show  bandwidth  that  is  actually used  at  least  95%  of the  time.


![](imageserver/uploadimages/image171.png)

MRTG  and  Cacti will calculate  the 95th percentile  for you.  This  is  a  sample   graph  of  a  960  kbps  connection.   The  95th  percentile came  to 945  kbps  after  discarding  the highest  5%  of traffic.

##   Monitoring RAM and CPU usage

By   definition,   servers   provide   critical   services   that   should   always   be available.  Servers  receive  and  respond  to client  machine  requests,  providing  access  to services  that are  the  whole  point  of  having  a  network  in  the  first  place. Therefore,     servers      must     have    sufficient hardware    capabilities     to accommodate  the work load.  This  means they  must  have  adequate  RAM,  storage,  and  processing  power to accommodate  the  number of client  requests. Otherwise,  the  server  will  take  longer  to  respond,  or  in  the  worst  case, may  be   incapable  of  responding  at  all. Since  hardware  resources  are finite, it is important  to keep  track of how system  resources  are  being used.  If a  core server  (such  as  a  proxy server  or  email server)  is overwhelmed  by requests,   access  times  become slow.

This  is  often  perceived  by  users  as  a  network  problem.  There  are  several programs  that  can  be  used  to  monitor  resources  on  a  server.  The  simplest method  on  a  Windows  machine  is  to  access  the Task  Manager  using  the Ctrl  Alt  +  Del  keys,  and  then  click  on  the  Performance  tab.  On  a  Linux or  BSD  box,  you  can  type  top  in  a  terminal  window.  To  keep  historical logs  of such  performance,  MRTG  or  RRDtool  can  also  be  used.

![](imageserver/uploadimages/image172.png)

Mail  servers  require  adequate  space,  as  some  people  may  prefer  to  leave their  email  messages  on  the server  for  long  periods  of time. The messages  can  accumulate  and  fill  the  hard  disk,  especially  if  quotas  are not  in  use. If   the   disk   or   partition   used   for   mail   storage   fills   up,   the  mail   server cannot  receive  mail.  If   that  disk  is  also  used  by  the  system,   all  kinds  of system   problems   may   occur   as   the   operating   system   runs   out   of   swap space and  temporary  storage. File servers  need  to  be  monitored,  even  if  they have  large disks.  Users  will  find  a  way  to  fill  any  size  disk  more  quickly  than  you  might think.

Disk   usage   can   be   enforced   through   the   use   of  quotas,   or   by  simply monitoring  usage  and  telling  people  when  they  are  using  too much. Nagios  can  notify  you  when  disk  usage,  CPU     utilisation,  or  other  system resources  
cross  a critical  threshold.  If  a  machine  becomes  unresponsive  or  slow,  and  measurements  show  that a  system  resource is  being  heavily  used,  this  may  be  an  indication  that  an upgrade   is   required.   If   processor   usage   constantly   exceeds   60%   of   the total,  it  may  be  time  to  upgrade  the  processor.  Slow  speeds  could  also  be as  a  result  of insufficient  RAM. Be sure  to  check  the overall  usage  of CPU, RAM,  and  disk space  before  deciding  to  upgrade  a particular  component. A  simple  way  to  check  whether  a  machine  has insufficient  RAM    is  to  look at  the hard  disk  light. When   the  light   is  on  constantly,   it   usually  means   that   the   machine   is constantly  swapping  large  amounts  of data  to  and  from  the disk.
This  is known  as  thrashing,  and  is extremely  bad for performance.
It  can  usually   be  fixed  by  investigating   which  process  is  using  the  most RAM,  and  killing  or  reconfiguring   that  process.  Failing   that,  the  system needs  more  RAM.  You  should  always  determine  whether  it  is  more  cost effective  to  upgrade  an  individual  component   or  purchase  a  whole   new machine.   Some  computers  are  difficult or  impossible to  upgrade,   and  it often  costs  more   to   replace   individual   components   than   to   replace   the entire   system.   Since   the   availability   of  parts   and   systems   varies   widely around  the  world,  be  sure  to  weigh  the  cost  of  parts  vs.  whole  systems, including shipping  and  taxes,  when  determining  the cost  of  upgrading.


##   Summary

In  summary  in  this  chapter  we've  tried  to  give  you an  insight  into  how  to monitor   your   network    and   computing    resources   cost   effectively    and efficiently.   We've   introduced   many  of  our   favourite   tools   to   assist   you. Many  of  them are  tried  and  tested  by many  network  operators.  Hopefully  you  have  understood   the  importance  of  monitoring   to  enable you   to    both   justify   upgrades    when   necessary    to    those   funding    the upgrades,  plus  minimise  the  impact  of problems  as  they occur.  The  end  result  is  keeping  your  network  and  computing  resources  healthy and  keeping   all of  your   users  happy  with  the  service   you  are  providing them.
