# MAGIC BOOK
 
A magic book is a self-replicating book.  This book consists of a digital and physical layer.  The digital book is a self-replicating set of "scrolls", which are web-based text documents.  

Scrolls are replicated using the scroll set replicators linked via the Chaos Magic symbol:

The url to put in there to access the scroll set server to replicate the scroll set for the Trash Magic Action Coloring Book is this address:

The physical layer is created by printing out the pdf found here:

[https://github.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/raw/main/booklettersizebooklet.pdf](https://github.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/raw/main/booklettersizebooklet.pdf)

Print this out double sided, and FLIP ON THE SHORT EDGE in the printer mode.  Fold down the spine, punch a sequence of hole spaced every 1/2 inch down the spine with a thumb tack, and back stitch the whole thing.  Fill out the book and color it in.  Share with others, show them how to replicate.
