**Action:** Color in the graphic of a circle replicating to more circles, draw whatever you want into the circles and contemplate the idea of a thing represented by a symbol replicating.

 - Life is magic.  
 - Self-replicating ideas are magic.  
 - Symbol magic is symbols which replicate, like a popular brand people copy.
 - Set magic is the creation of collections of things which replicate.
 - All ritual, practical, or ceremonial magic fits this description because it involves both replication of ritual and an intent to replicate a thought in the physical world outside the mind
 - Acts of creation depicted in religious traditions also fall under this definition as any would-be creator is also replicating their intent of creation out into the physical world
 - We can think of capitalism as a form of "number magic" in which systems of numbers replicate themselves
 - Trash magic is self-replicating systems built from trash, which contain the means of their own replication
