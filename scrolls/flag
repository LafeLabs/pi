Flags are used to represent links to [web sites](scrolls/web) and to the [TRASH ROBOT](scrolls/trashrobot) brand.  Block letters are cut out of felt and sewn onto a square of black cotton flannel 28-40 inches on a side, with hem sewn and then cut to take trash ties to tie to skeletron for hanging/flying on display.  Use rainbow colored felt.
