## Create the book

Print the above pdf two sided, be sure to flip on short edge rather than long edge if that is an option with your printer.

Stack all the pages in order, and fold in half so that the booklet is 8.5 inches by 5.5 inches, and so that the front cover is on the outside, which says the title of the book.

Draw dots every half inch, using your eyeball to judge how far in from the edge to make it. Exact dimensions don't matter, just make it about that distance and as even as you can.  

Punch holes on each dot with a thumb tack, with cardboard in the back of the booklet so the tack has somewhere to push into other than your leg.  

Either staple down the spine or stitch by hand using a needle and thread with a back stitch.  Tie knots at both ends of thread, cut off extra thread.

**TRASH ROBOT**

Now draw your first TRASH ROBOT.  See this example:

![](https://i.imgur.com/MkjWcsk.jpg)

The TRASH ROBOT avatar is just a rectangle with googley eyes and a black rectangle for a mouth, with 6 stripes colored in the simple rainbow sequence of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple. Notice the block letters which are based on starting with a square in your mind and just removing small simple amounts of the square to generate each letter.

This is the open brand of TRASH ROBOT.  Rainbows, googley eyes, and the block font with repeated rainbow colors.  This is simple, easy to copy, easy to recognize, and impossible to trademark.  No one owns this.  It belongs to us all.  We will be repeating this motif again and again in many media as we go along.

**MAGIC**
![](imageserver/uploadimages/image12.png)
![](imageserver/uploadimages/magicsymbols.png)

We define magic to be the replication of the desire to replicate a thing.   Magical things are things which impart in people the desire to copy those things, and which contain the information required to help make that happen.  

Rather than belabor the theory or general examples of this, we merely contemplate replication as an idea, and sketch it out with circles pointing out to more circles.  We aim to build media which *fully* replicates.  Not just replicating a message or meme, but replicating the entire system including all physical parts both physical and digital.

Color in the replicator symbols as you see fit, add things to the circles based on your own ideas.

**MAGIC SYMBOLS**

What symbols have resonance for you? What are the symbols you live by or want to live by?

**TRASHCORE**

Trash Robot is just the jumping off point.  We will build a whole fashion/brand aesthetic and use it to spread all the ideas here.  TRASHCORE.  Cut felt sewn onto black cotton flannel.  Block letters, rainbow and googly eyes.

Pages 5-7 TRASH MAGIC

**TRASH MAGIC** is the creation of things from trash which people have both the desire and ability to replicate.  We use the geometric programming language of Geometron to construct things and media which describe things as well as those things themselves, and the media which helps to replicate things.

In TRASH MAGIC  we are building a whole new civilization in which we abolish all mining and oil and gas, and all global supply chains and build things entirely from the waste of the old world we find in our local environment.  

TRASH MAGIC represents a flow between various elements: the TRASH FACTORY of products we provide to our community, the TRASH STATION where we distribute things, the TRASH ACADEMY where we teach TRASH MAGIC, the TRASH LABS where we develop new methods, and the TRASH FEED, the waste stream from which we get our materials.  

Each page gets filled in with the appropriate information for your situation. 

The BULLETIN BOARD is a page which can be used to post any kind of message to the community. You can advertise whatever you want to share here.  COMMUNITY RESOURCES is generally a place for mutual aid either needed by the community or available.  

The scroll with the 4 triangles in a triangle represents the [BOOK OF GEOMETRON](https://github.com/lafelabs/bookofgeometron/).  All the graphics in this work are created using the geometric programming language of GEOMETRON. 

The scroll with an infinite sequence of scrolls represents the idea of the self-replicating text.  This physical book as well as the digital versions all represent this kind of media.  

MAGIC BOOK refers to self-replicating books. This page can be used to document the digital side of this, the self-replicating web document which includes the Raspberry Pi with solar panels, etc.  This is a very self-referential page, which can have information about binding, printing, code, hardware or software--anything which replicates any kind of book.

WEB refers to the elements of our system which are on the Open Web.  We have instances of all our documents out on the web.  This can be paid hosted on purchased domains, free webhosts, local network web hosts, or Github repositories.  In all cases, we post relevant information here: IP addresses, web addresses, github info, etc.

STREETS refers to the situation in the world of streets of this physical document, be it a web server or a physical book.  What is the interstate corridor? What are the local US highways? State highways? Major city or town streets? Parking lots and shopping centers. Document it all here.

WATERSHED refers to where we are in the space of flowing water from sky to sea.
Document the whole system: streams, creeks, rivers, bays, oceans, sewers, fresh water.

TRAVELS documents the path of this book through the physical world.  Keep passing the book along! Document where it goes.  add more pages as needed.

EVENTS document where we are setting up TRASH MAGIC to share.  We can keep trying to find events, documenting when we show up, and spreading these ides so others do the same.

The SHAPE SET can get traced, cut out, laminated, and used to make bigger or smaller shapes which can be traced onto cardboard and cut out at any scale.  These are used to construct all other shapes and designs, and are used to make all of the elements of ACTION GEOMETRY.
