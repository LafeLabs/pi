Trash magic centers on a sun-trash-water cycle.  This map depicts our cosmology.  We use the geometric language of Geometron depicted by the three triangles in the magic book depicted by the scroll to replicate trash-built technology. We integrate this with the water-based ecosystem in which we exist, and drive it all directly from the sun.  We spread this system along the streets of the world depicted as "the street".
