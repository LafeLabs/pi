To create a web page with the GEOMETRON/TRASHROBOT system on it, get a web host set up and create a new file in the web directory called replicator.php and copy the code from an existing replicator into that, for example:

 - [www.trashrobot.org/php/replicator.txt](https://www.trashrobot.org/php/replicator.txt)
 - [php/replicator.txt](php/replicator.txt)

Then point your browser to [your web address]/replicator.php and wait for the page to load with a link to click on, and click through the link. Then you can copy scroll sets using the scroll set replicator as described in [MAGIC BOOK](scrolls/magicbook).
