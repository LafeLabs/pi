A board server is a collection of "boards", which are just text documents which are edited by users.  Think of them as virtual dry erase boards.  Anyone can write, edit, or delete anything, including a whole board.  From this screen, click on the home icon to go to the main server page.  Enter a new board name and a new board will appear in the editor.  Refresh your browser to see what other people have changes.  To delete a whole board click the red "x" icon and just click to delete.  

All the board files are stored in a directory called "[boards/](boards/)".  Sets of boards can be replicated from one server to anther using the set replicator at [boardset.html](boardset.html).  The board set replicator is found from the main board server page by clicking on the icon with the 8 arrows of chaos.  You have to open that page in order for the list of boards to update properly so that another server can replicate the board set from this  server.  The board set replicator has two server url inputs.  One of them is for the server from which you are copying boards and the other is the local server which you can copy, possibly with modifications, to another server to which you want to replicate *this* board set. This might be confusing.  It will be clearer if you just see it and try it.  

We can use board set replication to make flows of information from one server to another, and complex networks of replication can be built up.  This flow of information protects against destruction and keeps things dynamic and positively evolving.  Incoming board copies will have the word "copy" appended to their names.
