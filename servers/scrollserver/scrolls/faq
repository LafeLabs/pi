# Community Networking FAQ
 
**what is community networking?** Community networking is free network infrastructure which connects anyone with anyone else by mutual consent: if you want to send a message and someone wants to receive it, the operators will put the message through. If they don't want it, the operator will block it.  

**What is an operator?** Operators are people trained to create, replicate, and destroy documents in service to the community. 

**What can I do with a community network?**  You can share messages, stories, human connection, culture, history, food, water, housing, labor, ideas...anything which can be shared.  The Network exists to help anyone who wants to share anything with anyone else who wants to share.

**Is this a business?** No.  Network services are always provided for free to anyone who wants to share with no regard for ability to pay. Network operations help other people do business, but the operators themselves do not constitute a business.

**If this is not a business who owns it?** The software is all released into the Public Domain with no restrictions whatsoever so no one owns it.  The hardware is generally given away as part of STEM education programs funded by existing donors and operated through existing educational institutions or groups.  Part of our project of spreading the system is to donate the hardware to the community as a public free resource. It is maintained by Operators, but not owned by them, and can be passed from one to another without friction because there is no private information of any kind on any server.

**What about security?** The purpose of this network is the widest possible broadcast of messages to people who want to see them.  Security exists to prevent some people from accessing some information. This system has no barriers to the flow of information other than the consent of the recipient, which is ensured by responsible Operator activities.  Bad information can be immediately destroyed permanently at any time.
