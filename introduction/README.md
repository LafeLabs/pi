#  What is Community Networking?

 - the purpose of the network is to be a free resource for everyone in a community to share information with everyone they want to
 - all software is free and open source on a Public Domain license with no restrictions
 - all software contains scripts to automatically replicate to other servers
 - this is a network of places, living things, documents, and messages, not of "users"
 - there are no private data on this network, all documents and applications are public utilities
 - there is no "security", no passwords, no log ins, no user names
 - every document can be replicated to any server by any person at any time
 - every document can be edited by any person on any server at any time
 - every document can be deleted by anyone on any server at any time
 - communities are physically defined and local
 - no cloud, every server is understood and controlled individually by an operator
 - trained operators operate servers in each community
 - operators are trained to train more operators
 - all network stations are powered by off-grid electricity directly generated and stored on site
 - all stations extend network coverage from other existing stations or existing Internet connections
 - the network can operate locally even if the Internet is disconnected


# Community Networking FAQ
 
**what is community networking?** Community networking is free network infrastructure which connects anyone with anyone else by mutual consent: if you want to send a message and someone wants to receive it, the operators will put the message through. If they don't want it, the operator will block it.  

**What is an operator?** Operators are people trained to create, replicate, and destroy documents in service to the community. 

**What can I do with a community network?**  You can share messages, stories, human connection, culture, history, food, water, housing, labor, ideas...anything which can be shared.  The Network exists to help anyone who wants to share anything with anyone else who wants to share.

**Is this a business?** No.  Network services are always provided for free to anyone who wants to share with no regard for ability to pay. Network operations help other people do business, but the operators themselves do not constitute a business.

**If this is not a business who owns it?** The software is all released into the Public Domain with no restrictions whatsoever so no one owns it.  The hardware is generally given away as part of STEM education programs funded by existing donors and operated through existing educational institutions or groups.  Part of our project of spreading the system is to donate the hardware to the community as a public free resource. It is maintained by Operators, but not owned by them, and can be passed from one to another without friction because there is no private information of any kind on any server.

**What about security?** The purpose of this network is the widest possible broadcast of messages to people who want to see them.  Security exists to prevent some people from accessing some information. This system has no barriers to the flow of information other than the consent of the recipient, which is ensured by responsible Operator activities.  Bad information can be immediately destroyed permanently at any time.

**What is the role of teachers in the Network?** Teachers are the foundation of network replication.  Teachers train Operators in both the technical and social parts of being a skilled and responsible caretaker of a community network.  Teachers teach technology, philosophy, mathematics, art, culture, politics, history, marketing, operations, and anything else we build into the system as it evolves.  At its core, this project can be thought of as a school, where the teachers make up a decentralized faculty doing both research and teaching just like university faculty.  In many cases, faculty will in fact *be* faculty at existing universities or k-12 schools.  In some cases they will be totally independent, or work for existing STEM education organizations outside of formal schooling.  None of this impacts the basic mission, which is to replicate the system of community networking to directly provide benefit to the material conditions of the communities in which students live.

**What is organic media?** Organic media follows three rules: 
1. everything replicates(any user can copy any document to any other server at any time)
2. everything evolves(any user can edit any document at any time)
3. everything dies(any user can destroy any document at any time)

**How does organic media differ from viral media?**  Viral media is self-replicating information which replicates on a fixed host of some kind with restrictions on host replication.  For example, memes can replicate freely on a commercial social media platform, but copying the whole platform is prevented by existing legal and business frameworks.  In organic media, the whole system replicates: physical servers, social structures built around them, all the code, the whole team of skilled technicians who can improve the code, the logistics of operating the network and growing it and benefiting from it...*all* of this replicates freely in our system.

**What does "community" mean here?** For the purposes of this discussion, we take "community" to be physical, and very local.  In many cases it will be for an area a mile across, located at a central place where many local people go like a public library, park, school, religious building, or grocery store.  We are in most cases building new types of communities which are currently not connected at all, such as all the commuters passing a certain street corner every day.  We will make local physical places the center of a new *type* of community which is fact the oldest type.

**If everything is local, how does this network connect globally?** Our network will be connected from one community to another, but we build connections based on the *physical* world, not abstract virtual notions of shared interest.  Our network will grow along natural physical network connections like roads and rivers, as well as other existing right of ways like power line trails.  Nodes are also still all on the Internet, this network does not replace the existing networks overnight, it is a new network layer making connections which do not exist in the current Internet or phone system.

**If this is not a business how do Operators survive the current money-based economic system?**  If this network creates the kind of value it has the potential
