#  What is Community Networking?

 - the purpose of the network is to be a free resource for everyone in a community to share information with everyone they want to
 - all software is free and open source on a Public Domain license with no restrictions
 - all software contains scripts to automatically replicate to other servers
 - this is a network of places, living things, documents, and messages, not of "users"
 - there are no private data on this network, all documents and applications are public utilities
 - there is no "security", no passwords, no log ins, no user names
 - every document can be replicated to any server by any person at any time
 - every document can be edited by any person on any server at any time
 - every document can be deleted by anyone on any server at any time
 - communities are physically defined and local
 - no cloud, every server is understood and controlled individually by an operator
 - trained operators operate servers in each community
 - operators are trained to train more operators
 - all network stations are powered by off-grid electricity directly generated and stored on site
 - all stations extend network coverage from other existing stations or existing Internet connections
 - the network can operate locally even if the Internet is disconnected
